Template to create a project like [Between Page and Screen](http://betweenpageandscreen.com/). Uses the
[bps-binding](https://github.com/doolittle/bps-binding) library to bootstrap a ready-to-use project.

In your Flash project, include libs/BPS-Binding.swc. That should have all the external libraries that you'll need.

In the project-templates folder, you'll find an example file for a
[Jetbrains IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) project.

If you're using Jetbrains, Sublime, or others to compile the SWF, you may need to download the
[Flex SDK](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html).
